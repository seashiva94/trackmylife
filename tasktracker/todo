# Task Tracker

## Build Don't Talk!!
- come up with task specifications [done] [30 mins]
- write basic markdown parser [WIP] [2 hr]
- write service to track files and read data [todo] [2 hrs]
- save data in a database - pre-formatted local data > pre data service [todo] [2 hrs]
- dealing with tag ambiguity

## Research 
- read commonmark format and write a basic parser
    - all I need are headings, and list items -> tags are my thing
- read more docs and understand kibana data format
- index data based on tags <query search sort>
- tryout logstash to understand data format
    - I want to use my own data model and data aggregator
- maybe not using kibana since it only supports logstash currently ??
